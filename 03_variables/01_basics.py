# in python, variables are used to store data that can be used and manipulate throughout a program. a variable is created the moment you assign a value to it using the assignment operator (=).

age = 34 # integer 
name = "harry" #string
cgpa = 4.55 #float

#rule of definig a variables in python
#variables names must start with a letter (a-z) (A-Z) or an underscore (_).
#they can contain letter,number,and underscore.
#variables names are case-sensitive (age and Age are different).
#avoid using python keywords (e.g, if,for,while)as variable names.

#34age = 4 #invaild because variables cannot start with a number.
age  = 32 #vaild because variables can start with a
#3a$$ = 32 #vaild because variables cannot cintain special characters other than.
